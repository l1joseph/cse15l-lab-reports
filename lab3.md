Hey, 
Back for even more?

Today we'll be taking a deep dive into the grep command.

What is the grep command. The grep in the grep command stands for 'global regular expression print'. It is a that is command used to search and match text contained in standard output and text files.

Grep has tons on interesting command line options we can explore.

## 1. **Grep -o**

```bash
leojo@BobtheBuilder MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical (main)
$ grep -o "Six large controlled" */1468-6708-3-1.txt     
Six large controlled
```

```bash
leojo@BobtheBuilder MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical (main)
$ grep -o "President Clinton" */chapter-6.txt
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
President Clinton
```

In each of the above examples grep -o prints matched parts of a matching line only, instead of the whole line. It also separates each such match onto a serparate output line. For example, the first example shows trying to fine a specific case-matched phrase. While the second example shows all instances of 'President Clinton' within a file. The utility of this is pretty self evident, being able to use it as a ctrl+f type command to return only the string you want.

## 2. **Grep -i**

```bash
leojo@BobtheBuilder MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical (main)
$ grep -i "GENeral agreeMEnt" */*/DraftRecom-PDF.txt     
significant and general agreement. He indicated the process would
```
```bash
leojo@BobtheBuilder MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical (main)
$ grep -i "khalid sheikh" */chapter-13.4.txt
            2. Those detainees are Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Riduan Isamuddin (also
```

In each of these examples, we see that the capilization of the search term does not match the capitalization of the returned results. Grep -i makes it so that the input string and search is not case sensitive and instead returns any lines where the characters match, even if the capalizations do not. This is usefule to find names or to find strings where you are not sure of the capalization of certain terns, such as 'Khalid Sheikh' or miscapilization things like the first grep -i example.

## 3. **Grep -w**

```bash
leojo@BobtheBuilder MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical (main)
$ grep -w "so" */1468-6708-3-4.txt

$ grep  "chose" */preface.txt

```

In the above examples, there are two different searches for the same term (so & chose). One uses grep-w, and the other does not. The grep -w command seems to return much fewer results. When we look into why, we can see that it checks for whole words and not just occurances of the string, thus it eliminates all options where the search term is part of a substring of another word/string. This can be extremely useful to find words, and to remove cluttered results that aren't the word you are looking for.

## 4. **Grep -R**

```bash
leojo@BobtheBuilder MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical (main)
$ grep -wR selected 911report/
911report/chapter-1.txt:    When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans.
911report/chapter-1.txt:    While Atta had been selected by CAPPS in Portland, three members of his hijacking team-Suqami, Wail al Shehri, and Waleed al Shehri-were selected in Boston. Their selection affected only the handling of their checked bags, not their screening at the checkpoint. All five men cleared the checkpoint and made their way to the gate for American 11. Atta, Omari, and Suqami took their seats in business class (seats 8D, 8G, and 10B, respectively). The Shehri brothers had adjacent seats in row 2 (Wail in 2A, Waleed in 2B), in the firstclass cabin. They boarded American 11 between 7:31 and 7:40. The aircraft pushed back from the gate at 7:40.
911report/chapter-1.txt:    Shehhi and his team, none of whom had been selected by CAPPS, boarded United 175 between 7:23 and 7:28 (Banihammad in 2A, Shehri in 2B, Shehhi in 6C, Hamza al Ghamdi in 9C, and Ahmed al Ghamdi in 9D). Their aircraft pushed back from the gate just before 8:00.
911report/chapter-1.txt:    Hani Hanjour, Khalid al Mihdhar, and Majed Moqed were flagged by CAPPS. The Hazmi brothers were also selected for extra scrutiny by the airline's customer service representative at the check-in counter. He did so because one of the brothers did not have photo identification nor could he understand English, and because the agent found both of the passengers to be suspicious. The only consequence of their selection was that their checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that they had boarded the aircraft.
911report/chapter-1.txt:    Newark: United 93. Between 7:03 and 7:39, Saeed al Ghamdi, Ahmed al Nami, Ahmad al Haznawi, and Ziad Jarrah checked in at the United Airlines ticket counter for Flight 93, going to Los Angeles. Two checked bags; two did not. Haznawi was selected by CAPPS. His checked bag was screened for explosives and then loaded on the plane.

911report/chapter-1.txt:    At 8:52, in Easton, Connecticut, a man named Lee Hanson received a phone call from his son Peter, a passenger on United 175. His son told him: "I think they've taken over the cockpit-An attendant has been stabbed- and someone else up front may have been killed. The plane is making strange moves. Call United Airlines-Tell them it's Flight 175, Boston to LA." Lee Hanson then called the Easton Police Department and relayed what he had heard.

Here we can see that the grep -R command allows us to search recurvely through directories for instances of our search string. We can also see that we can pair command line options together. Grep -wR searches for instances of a word recursively throughout a directory, while grep -iR searches for a string irrespective of capitalization. This is useful because now we can grep through the contents of whole directories instead of going into each individual file/folder in a directory.
